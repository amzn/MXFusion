    Modules are a combined Model/Posterior + Inference algorithm object in MXFusion. They act as Factors and are defined as such during model definition, producing Random Variables like a typical Distribution. During inference, instead of the Module having a closed form solution, the outside inference algorithm will call the module's internal inference algorithm to perform modular inference.
