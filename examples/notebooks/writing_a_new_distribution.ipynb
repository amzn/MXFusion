    "There are 4 primary methods to fill out for a Distribution in MXFusion:\n",
    "* ```__init__```  - This is the constructor for the Distribution. It takes in any parameters the distribution needs. It also defines names for the input variable\\[s\\] that the distribution takes and the output variable\\[s\\] it produces.\n",
    "* ```log_pdf``` - This method returns the logarithm of probabilistic density function for the distribution. This is called during Inference time as necessary to perform the Inference algorithm.\n",
    "* ```draw_samples``` - This method returns drawn samples from the distribution. This is called during Inference time as necessary to perform the Inference algorithm.\n",
    "* ```define_variable``` - This is used to generate random variables drawn from the Distribution used during model definition.\n",

    "In addition, a distribution can take in additional parameters used for calculating that aren't inputs. We refer to these additional parameters as the Distribution's ```attributes```. The difference between an input and an attribute is primarily that inputs are dynamic at inference time, while attributes are static throughout a given inference run. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, ```minibatch_ratio``` is a static attribute, as it doesn't change for a given minibatch size during inference. \n",

These names are used when printing and generally inspecting the model, so give meaningful names. We prefer names like ```mean``` and ```variance``` to ones like ```location``` and ```scale``` or greek letters like ```mew``` and ```sigma```."
